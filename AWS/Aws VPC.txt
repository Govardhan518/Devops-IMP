A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. 
It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS Cloud.
You can launch your AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, into your VPC. You can specify an 
IP address range for the VPC, add subnets, associate security groups, and configure route tables. 

Virtual networking is a technology that facilitates data communication 
between two or more virtual machines (VM). It is similar to traditional computer networking but 
provides interconnection between VMs, virtual servers and other related components in a virtualized
computing environment.

A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. You can launch AWS resources into a specified subnet. 
Use a public subnet for resources that must be connected to the internet, 
and a private subnet for resources that won't be connected to the internet.
