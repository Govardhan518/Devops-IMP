Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) is a load-balancing service for Amazon Web Services (AWS) deployments. 
ELB automatically distributes incoming application traffic and scales resources to meet traffic demands.
ELB helps an IT team adjust capacity according to incoming application and network traffic. 
Users enable ELB within a single availability zone or across multiple availability zones to maintain consistent application performance.
Historically, load balancing divides the amount of work that a computer has to do among multiple computers so that users, in general, get served faster.
ELB offers enhanced features including:
  1. Detection of unhealthy Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances.
  2. Spreading instances across healthy channels only.
  3. Flexible cipher support.
  4. Centralized management of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates.
  5. Optional public key authentication. 
  6. Support for both IPv4 and IPv6.
ELB offers two different load balancer features, which help provide scalable cloud computing capacity. 
The Application Load Balancer handles advanced traffic routing from other services or containers at 
the application level, while the Classic Load Balancer spreads app or network traffic across EC2 instances.
